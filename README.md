# basic-recommender-system

This code has been implemented for **basic understanding of Recommender Systems**.
This uses **collaborative filtering**.

A collaborative filtering algorithm works by finding a set of people with preferences or tastes similar to the target user. Using this smaller set of “similar” people, it constructs a ranked list of suggestions.

Approaches used to find similarity:
* Euclidean distance score
* Pearson Correlation Coefficient score
